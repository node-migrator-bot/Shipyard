Modules
=======

Shipyard fully embraces a module system, similar to CommonJS or nodejs'
modules. In fact, a feature of Shipyard is that you can open a nodejs
shell and interact with your application, or any part of Shipyard, from
the command line.

This module system allows app developers to declare what parts of
Shipyard they need to use, and only those parts are downloaded by the
end-users.
